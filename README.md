## What is wiper

Wiper is a browser plugin (currently Firefox) that strips search engine (currently Google) results based on your custom blacklist.


## Wiper 0.9.1 (beta- latest)
New features/improvements:
1. Popup option instead of the sidebar. This allows for much shorter time in adding newer keywords and websites.
2. Quick toggle enable/disable option. This was not possible before.
3. New UI design as per https://design.firefox.com/photon/index.html so thinks look sleek and are as usable as possible!

Available on Firefox Add-ons [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wiper/)

## Wiper 0.1

Targets `google.*/search` and removes results that are in the blacklist (defined in the scripts).
